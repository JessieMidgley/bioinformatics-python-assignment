You are given a fastA format file of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome (saccharomyces_cerevisiae_2022.fna) and a gff-format file for the genome (saccharomyces_cerevisiae_2022.gff).

Using the 2 files, find the sequence of every gene (gene) and calculate the frequency of use of every possible codon, normalized (to 1 or percentage) to the total number of codons in the genome.

The codon frequency can be printed out as the codon text, followed by the normalized frequency, i.e.:

AAA       0.01

AAC       0.002

AAG       0.0033

etc.
